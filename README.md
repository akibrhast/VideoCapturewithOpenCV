# SpyWareOpenCv
The aim of this project is to utilize various python libraries and create a program that is able to :
 1. Take Video
 2. Listen to audio
 3. Take Screenshots
 4. Have the ability to send recorded files via email
 5. Have the ability to be remotely turned on an off
 6. Remote live view
 7. Future abilities to be added as my programing skillz grow

## Getting Started
* Currently the program is at its infancy, to use a copy of the project and play around with it within your system, I high reccomend using virtualenv.</li>
* Installation and documentation to get started with virtualenv can be found here : [Virtualenv Set Up](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtualenv/)
* I am running the script with python 3.6.6, and it also works with 3.6.3
* The different version of the libraries and their version are within the file "requirements.txt"
